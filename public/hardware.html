              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>The BMP_180 is a temperature and pressure sensor manufactured by Bosh. My Goal was to write my own library using I2C in order to operate the device and access temperatures in my building. After doing this, My goal was to use the onboard WIFI in order to send POST requests to my website so I could monitor temperatures wherever I was through my website.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                Referenced datasheet in order to write C++ code to communicate with the BMP180 sensor via I2C.
                </li>
                <li>
                Used a logic analyzer in order to debug I2C communication while referencing the datasheet and known good examples.
                </li>
                <li>
                Integrated WiFi communication to communicate with node.js server and post temperatures.

              <h3>Summary</h3>
              <p>Starting this project, I learned the basics of SPI communication (MISO, MOSI, SS,CLK) and wrote basic functions in order to power on the device and initate readings. Along the way, I used both a logic analyser and oscilliscope to debug my program. Next I worked on implementing more functionality of the adxl345 such as chanign data rate, tap detection, and interrupt handling. Next, I hope to convert the project to freeRTOS and C in order to more easily handle interrupts and bring my code closer to code seen in production.</p>

              <h3>Summary</h3>
              <hr class="solid">

              <h4>Need</h4>
              <p>The need for this project started after I hosted my own local music server and was able to start playing music from my phone, but needed to physically turn on the
                reciever and switch inputs. I figured if I could salvage an IR led from a previous remote and connect it to an esp32 using bluetooth or wifi, I could control the reciever
                remotely.
              </p>

              <h4>The Project</h4>
              <p>
                I used an IR led from an unused remote and connected it to my oscilliscope in order to view the data being sent from the reciver's remote for various commands such as ON, INPUT ETC. I then
                measured the lengths of these pulses and wrote a c++ program to mimmick this behaviour. On testing this, it did not work!. At first, I attributed this to the strength of the IR led, so I reduced it's resistance
                hoping for an improvement. However, this yeilded no success. Upon further research, I discovered my problem was twofold. First, my timing for what should be interpereted as a 1 and 0 were slightly off, and second the signal used
                a 40khz carrier wave. I fixed the first by simply adjusting the timing, and the second I wrote a function to oscillate a signal at 40khz when it was specified to be on. After testing this out, it worked!
              
              </p>
              <p>
                My process for sending bits to the IR led was rudimentary so I improved it by using bitwise operations on a 16bit word of data in order to send a bit, then shift the remaining bits until none were left.
                Next, I researched the bluetooth capabilities of the ESP32 and BluetoothSerial library that would work. I then downloaded a serial terminal on my phone and was able to send commands to the receiver through character input over
                Bluetooth!
